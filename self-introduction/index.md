Hi everyone!

My name is Tanya. I from is Belarus.

In 2021, we moved to another country and the need for employment arose. That's when I had the opportunity to realize my long-held dream.

Back in 9th grade, I fell in love with computer science. I never missed these classes.
Missed English lessons, unfortunately

Then I entered Vitebsk State Technological University,
to specialize in Economics and Enterprise Management.

And even built career to lead labor and wage economist. Now I realize why I was able to work about 10 years in this field.
The secret is that I had to work a lot with the 1C program and to ease my work and work my department it was
necessary to implement version 8 of the 1C program together with the programmers.

There I learned to work in a team, gained leadership and communication skills and take responsibility for the work I do. I've always been interested in how it works from the inside, what beautiful solutions to problems there are, what interesting algorithms there are, but it's not easy to dare to change profession when you're about 40 years old.

And now that I have the opportunity and I am inspired by my family and friends - there are no barriers for me and I move only forward!

I didn't know anything about programming.

So for me, I think I started from absolute zero.

The first entry I had was on Stage 1 and it was very, very difficult. I didn't pass 70 percent of Stage 1. But I knew exactly what I needed and what my level was.
I just kept doing the tasks and writing code and didn't stop.

My favorite projects during my training are everything. Library is an adaptive landing page of the library website
Coffee-House is a website consisting of two pages. Hangman is a classic word game. Nonograms is a puzzle game.

In projects, the initial body in the index.html file should be empty (only the script tag is allowed), and all necessary elements are generated using JS.

In the future I would like to implement: games, task trackers, applications on React.

Now a few words about me and my interests. I really like to socialize with people. I really like to be friends. I love to help people. I love holidays, traditions, getting together with friends, board games, traveling, and learning new things.
I spend a lot of time in the gym and I am passionate about good nutrition.

I hope I didn't bore you if you watched to the end.

Bye everyone and see you all again!
